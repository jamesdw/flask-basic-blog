A **modular Flask application** built using the **App Factory Pattern** and **Blueprints** for better scalability and maintainability. This lightweight blogging platform is perfect for learning Flask architecture or bootstrapping a more complex web app.  There is no blogging as of yet.  It='s just a fance user system at the moment.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
Using blueprints and going for a modular approach.  Each module has its own folder, its own blueprint, forms, templates and services.  ORginally, had everything in layers grouped by function, so a folder for routes, folder for models, folder for services.  But realized this modular approach seems to be "best practice" as suggested by the flask documentation
